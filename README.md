# bypass
It's both a bypass and an obfuscator, kinda wild ðŸ˜³

# How to use

I basically put a tiny guide inside the index.lua file. This is what you'll be running. You can take a look at it, that's why it's open sourced.

I recommend hosting this on either EC3 (paid) or repl.it (free). 

# How it works
 
To put it simply, bytecode conversion is done to achieve an "unreadable" status. You can check out an almost 10 year old official blog by Roblox [here](https://blog.roblox.com/2012/08/bye-bye-bytecode/) . Because Roblox isn't intended to read bytecode, it's extremely difficult for any automated system to detect any wrongdoing, so it goes ahead and executes it. This allows for an almost unbannable game (by automation, humans can still take it down very quick, but that aint my problem).

If you want, you can create a pull request, however I severely doubt that most people viewing this have the capacity to even understand what this does, nevertheless fix a bug/vulnerability.
